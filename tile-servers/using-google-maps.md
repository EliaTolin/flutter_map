Google Maps is a popular pay-as-you-go tile provider solution, especially for large commercial applications.

Unfortunately, Google Maps does not officially document - and therefore support - a static raster tile server. There is an open and free endpoint (findable by doing a small amount of digging online), but it is unclear whether it violates their ToS or not, so it is not listed as usable here.

To use Google Maps properly, you will need to use the official Flutter package.
