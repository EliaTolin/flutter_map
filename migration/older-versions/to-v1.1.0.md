# To v1.1.0

The old method of adding attribution through `attributionBuilder` on a `TileLayer` has been deprecated. You should now use [`AttributionWidget`](../../usage/layers/attribution-layer.md), as this fixes issues with the old implementation.

There are other bug fixes, but no other breaking changes associated with this release.
