## Feature Highlights

<details>

<summary>Supports Any* Map Style</summary>

Through the `templateUrl` argument, you can add any raster tile server that supports WMTS. So you're not just limited to Google Maps or Mapbox anymore. And through `WMSOptions`, you can also use any WMS raster tile server, with similar setup.

Vector tile support is not built in, but it is supported in beta by a plugin!

</details>

<details>

<summary>Simple Setup</summary>

No need for API keys or excessive platform specific setup. Just depend on it and set it up in less than 5 minutes.

After that, you can add a map controller to programmatically control your map, such as position, zoom, and more!

</details>

<details>

<summary>Wide Ecosystem Of Plugins</summary>

Can't find what you need built in? There's probably a plugin for that!

From tracking the user's location to caching tiles for offline use, this is all supported by 3rd party plugins!
