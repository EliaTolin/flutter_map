There are many independently maintained plugins created by the 'flutter\_map' community that give extra, prebuilt functionality, saving you even more time and potentially money.

However, you may not be able to find an existing plugin, in which case you need to make it yourself. This should be a rough guide on how you can make these plugins.

## Submitting A New Plugin

If you've made your own plugin that you're willing to share, you can add it to this list by creating a pull request in GitHub. We're always looking forward to see what you've made!

When submitting a plugin & PR, please ensure the plugin:

* _preferably_ includes 'flutter\_map\_' in the name
* _preferably_ available via a pub.dev installation
* has good documentation (information for installation and basic setup/functionality)
* includes a runnable example and/or screenshots/screen-recordings
* has a description that accurately and concisely represents your plugin

If you want to provide extra assistance to your users in a shared space, consider the official 'flutter\_map' Discord server! Join using the button at the top of this page, and ping '@Github Maintainer' to be added to the 'Plugin Owner' role. You can then be easily identified and provide help or announcements in a dedicated plugins channel.
